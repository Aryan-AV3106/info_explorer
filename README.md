# 🌐 Info Explorer

A simple Python command-line tool I built as a beginner to explore live data using real-world APIs!  
This is one of my first hands-on projects using `urllib`, JSON, and file handling in Python.

---

## 🚀 What You Can Do

1. ☁️ **Check City Weather**  
   Enter any city and get its current temperature, humidity, and weather condition (powered by OpenWeatherMap API).

2. 🌍 **Get Country Info**  
   Type a country name to fetch its capital, population, and region (using REST Countries API).

3. 🌌 **View NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day**  
   See NASA’s featured photo of the day with a short explanation (via NASA APOD API).

## 💡 What I Learned

- How to fetch and read data from **public APIs** using `urllib`
- How to parse **JSON responses** and extract specific information
- How to handle errors and edge cases when working with APIs
- Writing outputs to a `.txt` file
- Structuring a basic **menu-driven CLI program**

## 📂 Files Included

- `Info_explorer.py` → Main Python script  
- `sample_output.txt` → Output file storing user-requested data  
- `.gitignore` → To avoid pushing unnecessary files  
- `README.md` → This file!

## 🚧 Still Learning!

This was a fun beginner project that made me more confident with live data and building small tools.  
I’m excited to keep learning and improving — any feedback is welcome! 🙌
